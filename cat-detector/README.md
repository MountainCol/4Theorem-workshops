## Prerequsities
For this workshop you will need:

* A development machine with Docker installed [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker]( https://docs.docker.com/get-docker)
* An AWS account
* AWS API access keys: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

## Structure
The workshop is divided into 10 easy to follow stages so that you can work along as we build the system.
