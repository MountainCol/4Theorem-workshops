In this workshop we will build a serverless image recognition system on AWS. The system will use a number of AWS technologies including S3, Lambda, SQS and Amazons image recognition AI service Rekognition.

## Prerequsities
linux VM perhaps??
For this workshop you will need:

* A development machine with Docker installed
* An AWS account
* AWS API access keys: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

## Structure
The workshop is divided into 10 easy to follow stages so that you can work along as we build the system.

The steps are:

* [step1-overview](./step1-overview/README.md)
* [step2-setup](./step2-setup/README.md)
* [step3-rekognition](./step3-rekognition/README.md)
* [step4-serverless](./step4-serverless/README.md)
* [step5-infrastructure](./step5-infrastructure/README.md)
* [step6-crawler](./step6-crawler/README.md)
* [step7-analysis](./step7-analysis/README.md)
* step8-ui
* step9-full
* step10-wrapup

There will also be some coding to depoy, run and test along the way so grab some coffee, roll up your sleves and lets get started with [step1](./step1-overview/README.md)
