# Cat Detector Step 8 - UI Service
So far we have deployed our Crawler and Analysis services and tested them which is great, but we are missing a user interface. To enable this we will need to provide some kind of API! This is what we will deploy in this step.

The code for the UI service is in the `system/ui-service` directory in this repository.
