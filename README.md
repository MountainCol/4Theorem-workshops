FourTheorem Workshops- Cat Detector

This is the FourTheroem Cat Dectector workshop where AWS services like S3, AWS Rekognition (an AI image detector) and others are used to determine what breed of cat specific photos are, and I hope that this can be the start of a larger image detection framework for things such as Fungi recognition, leaf recognition, amongst other things.

There is a data set provided by Kaggle to use and if there are other databases that I can access (even through the AWS database repo) then I will have a look and see what I can do! 

Exciting stuff!!
